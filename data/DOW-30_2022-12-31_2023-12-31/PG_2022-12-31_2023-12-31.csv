They declined more than 9% compared to S&P's 12% gain so far. A surge in treasury yields, signs of a weakening consumer and the strong dollar all weighed on the sector. But is now the time to scoop in and buy some of those beaten down names? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to get their top stock picks. UBS U.S. Household and Personal Care Analyst Peter Grom provided his thoughts on the consumer staples sector overall. Grom said, \""You have this perfect storm of events that's driving the weaker performance of consumer staples ... last year, even though rates were rising, I think the market was more positioned with the defensive tilt, and I think we're kind of seeing some normalization of that.\"" PepsiCo (PEP) reported third quarter results that topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston explained the company's approach with regard to the consumer. He said, \u201cWe plan the consumer conservatively, that's typically been our practice, and more often than not, the consumer surprises us on the upside. So, we put ourselves in a good position to meet or beat our guidance.\u201d Procter & Gamble (PG) reported first quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. Regarding consumer spending, P&G CEO Jon Moeller said, \u201cThey're continuing to buy our products. Our market share in the quarter that we just completed, for example, in the US was up 50 basis points just from a value standpoint, 60 basis points on a volume standpoint. Our global aggregate share was up 40 basis points.\u201d Portfolio Wealth Advisors President & CIO Lee Munson provided his thoughts on consumer staples including Hershey (HSY). Munson said, \""Hershey is down double digits from its high this year. There used to be a time when a stock had a 2.5% dividend that was actually higher than a ten-year treasury and people loved it.
