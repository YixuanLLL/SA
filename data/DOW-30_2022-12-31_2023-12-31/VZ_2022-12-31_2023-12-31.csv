Vestberg discusses adapting to changes in consumer behavior itself, noting Verizon's prepaid business segment has struggled and faces disruptions from most customers' preference for postpaid plans. Additionally, he says the overall U.S. consumer market \""is shrinking\"" as people curb spending. Offers that previously worked, like new phones for all, are less effective lately, Vestberg says.

He attributes this partially to Verizon's business model and strategy.
