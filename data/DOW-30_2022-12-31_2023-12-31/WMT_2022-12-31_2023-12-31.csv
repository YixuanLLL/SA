On where consumers are focused Widlitz explains: \""Obviously consumers are spending on necessities, you know, we're talking about disinflation and that's great, but the bottom line is food costs are up 20% on a two-year basis and that's not declining, that's just stagnating.

In May, Elon Musk named Linda Yaccarino the new CEO of Twitter. In July, Musk changed Twitter\u2019s name to X. 9.

Taylor Swift and the Taylor-made economy (00:00:56) It was a big year for Taylor Swift as she embarked on her Eras Tour and released Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert film. Swift also received several mentions in financial news for her impact on the economy and consumer spending. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer breaks down some of Swift\u2019s recognitions in the world of finance news. On July 12, Swift received a mention in the Fed Beige Book as the Philadelphia Fed noted the boost in hotel sales and the economy when her Eras Tour came to town.

Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year. We won\u2019t know retail theft\u2019s impact for 2023 till next year, but Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brooke DiPalma takes a look at the average shrink rate in 2022. According to the National Retail Federation, there was $112.1 billion of losses in fiscal year 2022, which was up 1.6 percent year-over-year. Organized retail theft made up 36 percent of that number, while internal theft made up 29 percent. Process errors made up 27 percent and unknown reasons made up the last seven percent. 5. Weight Loss Drug Craze (00:01:56) Weight loss drugs have grown in popularity this year. Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the GLP-1 drugs. \u201cThere\u2019s type 2 diabetes drugs and weight loss drugs that make up the class of GLP-1 drugs\u2026 The diabetes drugs are Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Mounjaro, which are both available off-label for weight loss,\u201d Khemlani notes. Yahoo Finance named Novo Nordisk as the 2023 Company of the Year, as the company's Ozempic and Wegovy are very popular drugs in the weight loss space. 4. Union Strikes (00:02:15) The entertainment and automotive industry were both impacted by strikes this year as Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and United Auto Workers went on strike. The WGA went on strike in May and the SAG joined the writers on the picket line in July. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal notes that although the WGA and SAG are different, \u201cthe threadline is similar, in terms of what they were fighting for.\u201d Some elements in the actors' deal included, 7% general wage hike, AI protections, and $40 million a year streaming residual bonus. The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3. Collapse of Regional Banks (00:02:33) Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were two of the regional banks that collapsed this year. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the timeline of the collapses. On March 8, SVB planned an emergency stock sale and on March 9, customers attempted to withdraw $42 billion. On March 10, regulators shut down SVB and two days later, on March 12, regulators shutdown Signature Bank. 2. The Fed (00:03:06) Inflation and interest rates continued to impact Americans this year. \u201cThe Central Bank began 2023 slowing the pace of its most aggressive rate hiking campaign to cool inflation since the 1980s,\u201d Yahoo Finance Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains. \u201cAs 2023 comes to an end, that campaigns appears to be all but over.\u201d 1.

Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley takes a look at the year AI has had. \u201cTo say that 2023 was the year of AI, would be the understatement of, well, the year,\u201d Howley says. In second quarter 2023, AI was mentioned 62 times at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), 58 times at Microsoft (MSFT), and 827 times in total for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to Reuters.

In May 2023, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) market value \u201cbriefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time. Cementing its status as the AI chip leader,\u201d Howley explains.
