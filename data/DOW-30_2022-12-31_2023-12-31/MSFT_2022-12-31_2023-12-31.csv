Swift also received several mentions in financial news for her impact on the economy and consumer spending. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer breaks down some of Swift\u2019s recognitions in the world of finance news. On July 12, Swift received a mention in the Fed Beige Book as the Philadelphia Fed noted the boost in hotel sales and the economy when her Eras Tour came to town.

Retail Theft (00:01:37) Retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and The Home Depot (HD) all noted retail theft this year.

According to the National Retail Federation, there was $112.1 billion of losses in fiscal year 2022, which was up 1.6 percent year-over-year.

Yahoo Finance named Novo Nordisk as the 2023 Company of the Year, as the company's Ozempic and Wegovy are very popular drugs in the weight loss space. 4. Union Strikes (00:02:15) The entertainment and automotive industry were both impacted by strikes this year as Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and United Auto Workers went on strike. The WGA went on strike in May and the SAG joined the writers on the picket line in July.

The writers' deal included minimum pay increases of 5%-4%-3.5% over 3 years, 50% residual viewership-based bonus, and AI protections. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian discusses the \u201cunprecedent strategy of stand-up strikes starting in mid-September\u201d when the UAW went on strike against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), striking all three. 3.
